- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nigel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding things for fun and learning new things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and a bit of Python.

- I use github as a place to see my progress with coding, so many of the projects may be small or or useless. But they probably are practice for me to learn new concepts.
